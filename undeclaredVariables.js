//In Js you can create a variable without declaring it as follows
x = 5;
y = 7;
z = x + y;
console.log(`${x} + ${y} = ${z}`);

//Note: It is considered considered a good practice to always declare a variable before use.
// It is also a good practice to declare all your variables at the beginning of the script
