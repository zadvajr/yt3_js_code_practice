//In Js if you declare a variable and you did not assign value to it, that variable will be of type undefined and value of undefined.

//Example
let x;
console.log(`The datatype of 'x' is ${typeof x} and the value is '${x}'`);

let y = undefined;
console.log(`Type of y: ${typeof y}, value: ${y}`);

z = "";
console.log(typeof z);
console.log(z);
